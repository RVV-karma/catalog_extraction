## 📋 Slides / Documentation

### Slide 1: Problem Framing & KPIs

**Business Goal:**
Automate catalog enrichment to ensure product listings are complete, accurate, and consistent.

**Metrics Mapping:**

| Business Metric | Product Metric | Model Metric |
|----------------|----------------|--------------|
| Catalog Completeness | % products with all attributes | Extraction Coverage |
| Catalog Accuracy | Customer trust score | Precision, Recall, F1 |
| Processing Speed | Time to enrich catalog | Latency (ms/product) |
| Operational Cost | Budget efficiency | Cost per 1k products |

**Model/System Metrics:**
1. **Precision/Recall/F1** - Accuracy of extracted attributes against ground truth
2. **Extraction Coverage** - % of products with successful extraction
3. **Latency** - Average processing time per product
4. **Normalization Accuracy** - Consistency of value mapping (e.g., "navy" → "blue")

**Service SLOs:**
- **P95 Latency:** ≤ 100ms per product (rule-based, no LLM calls)
- **Cost per 1k requests:** $0 (pure regex/pattern matching, no API costs)
- **Accuracy Constraint:** ≥ 90% F1 for primary attributes (Color, Brand)

### Slide 3: Implementation (Catalog Understanding)

**Datasets:**
- **Product Catalog:** [Fashion Clothing Products Catalog (Myntra)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/fashion-clothing-products-catalog)
  - **Size:** 12,762 products
  - **Validation:** 1,500 sample products with ground truth
  - **Attributes:** ProductID, ProductName, Description, ProductBrand, Gender, PrimaryColor
- **Color Names:** [Color Names Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/avi1023/color-names)
  - **Size:** 1,291 color names
  - **Usage:** Pattern matching for color extraction

**Implementation Approach:**

**1. Color Extraction:**
- Loaded 1,291 color names, cleaned brackets/parentheses
- Added "grey" (British spelling) for dataset compatibility
- Regex matching in product name and description
- Handles multiple colors per product
- **HSL-based normalization:** Reduces 106 extracted colors → 11 base colors
  - Uses Hue, Saturation, Lightness values for color science-based mapping
  - Base colors: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Pink, Brown, Black, White, Grey
  - Examples: Navy → Blue, Mustard → Yellow, Beige → Brown

**2. Gender Extraction:**
- 18 gender terms (men, women, boys, girls, kids, unisex, etc.)
- Word boundary matching to avoid false positives
- Normalization: man→men, woman→women, boy→boys, etc.

**3. Brand Extraction:**
- Uses extracted colors and genders as **boundaries**
- Extracts text before first gender/color keyword
- Handles hyphenated compound words (e.g., "Gold-Toned")
- Multi-word brand support (e.g., "U.S. Polo Assn.")

**Results:**

| Attribute | Total Products | Correct | Wrong | Accuracy | Coverage |
|-----------|---------------|---------|-------|----------|----------|
| **Color** | 1,378 | 1,377 | 1 | **99.93%** | 91.9% |
| **Gender** | 1,500 | 1,249 | 251 | **83.27%** | 100% |
| **Brand** | 1,500 | 1,402 | 98 | **93.47%** | 91.1% |

**Key Insights:**

- **Color Extraction:** Near-perfect accuracy. Only 1 error was a data quality issue (label: "Matte" instead of "Tan")
- **Gender Extraction:** Good performance. Errors mainly on products without gender keywords (jewelry, accessories, home items)
- **Brand Extraction:** Excellent accuracy. Improved from 82.67% to 93.47% by:
  - Using extracted colors/genders as boundaries
  - Handling hyphenated compound words
  - Splitting on hyphens to detect color sub-words

**Latency:**
- **Average:** ~0.05ms per product (regex-based)
- **1,500 products:** ~75ms total (negligible)

**Cost:**
- **$0** - No LLM API calls, pure pattern matching

**Error Analysis:**

*Color Extraction (1 error):*
- Maybelline Foundation labeled as "Matte" (finish, not color) → Correctly extracted "Tan"

*Gender Extraction (251 errors):*
- 83% are products without gender keywords (bags, jewelry, home items, sarees)
- 1 data labeling error found: "Roadster Women Joggers" labeled as "Men"

*Brand Extraction (98 errors):*
- Multi-word brands missing last word (e.g., "U.S. Polo Assn. Kids" → "U.S. Polo Assn.")
- Sub-brands included (e.g., "CASIO Enticer" instead of "CASIO")
- Products with no color/gender boundary → returns None (can add fallback)

### Slide 4: Rollout & Monitoring

**Testing Strategy:**

**Phase 1 - Offline Validation:**
1. **Unit Tests:** Test edge cases (hyphenated colors, multi-word brands, special characters)
2. **Red-team Prompts:** Test unusual product names, missing data, edge cases
3. **Ground Truth Validation:** Compare against 1,500 labeled products
4. **Error Analysis:** Categorize and prioritize error types

**Phase 2 - Shadow Mode:**
1. Run extraction pipeline in parallel with existing system
2. Compare results without affecting production
3. Monitor extraction coverage and accuracy
4. Identify patterns of failures

**Phase 3 - Canary Deployment:**
1. Roll out to 5% of catalog products
2. Monitor metrics:
   - **Extraction accuracy** (compare with manual labels)
   - **Processing latency** (P50, P95, P99)
   - **Coverage rate** (% products with extracted attributes)
   - **Error rate** (% failed extractions)

**Phase 4 - Gradual Rollout:**
1. Increase to 25% → 50% → 100% based on metrics
2. A/B test downstream impact (catalog completeness, search relevance)

**Monitoring Dashboard:**

| Metric | Target | Alert Threshold |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Color Accuracy | ≥ 99% | < 95% |
| Brand Accuracy | ≥ 93% | < 85% |
| Gender Accuracy | ≥ 83% | < 75% |
| P95 Latency | ≤ 100ms | > 200ms |
| Processing Errors | < 1% | > 5% |

**Rollback Criteria:**
- Accuracy drops > 10% from baseline
- P95 latency > 200ms
- Error rate > 5%
- Downstream metrics degradation (e.g., search quality)

**Continuous Improvement:**
1. **Weekly:** Review error samples, update regex patterns
2. **Monthly:** Retrain on new labeled data, expand color/gender dictionaries
3. **Quarterly:** Evaluate LLM-based extraction for zero-shot generalization

├── data_loader.py          # Load Myntra dataset
├── color_extractor.py      # Color extraction + evaluation
├── gender_extractor.py     # Gender extraction + evaluation
├── brand_extractor.py      # Brand extraction + evaluation
└── extract_all.py          # Full pipeline + summary

data/
├── myntra_products_catalog.csv  # Product data
└── color_names.csv              # 1291 color names
```

**Running the Pipeline:**

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run full extraction pipeline
python -m catalog_extraction.extract_all

# Run individual extractors
python -m catalog_extraction.color_extractor
python -m catalog_extraction.gender_extractor
python -m catalog_extraction.brand_extractor
```

**Implementation Highlights:**

1. **Modular Design:** Each extractor is independent, can be used separately
2. **Reusability:** Color and gender extractors are reused by brand extractor
3. **Validation:** Built-in evaluation against ground truth
4. **No External Dependencies:** Pure pandas + regex (no LLM APIs)

**Future Work:**

**Why Start with Regex/Rules (Not LLM)?**
- ✅ **Zero cost** - No API charges
- ✅ **Fast** - < 0.1ms per product vs 100-500ms for LLM
- ✅ **Deterministic** - Predictable, debuggable, no hallucinations
- ✅ **Good baseline** - 93-99% accuracy for most attributes
- ✅ **Easy to maintain** - Update regex patterns vs prompt engineering

**Short-term Improvements:**
1. Add fallback logic for brand extraction (first N words, capitalized patterns)
2. Expand gender detection with product category hints (bra → women, saree → women)
3. Add material extraction (cotton, silk, leather, etc.)
4. Add size extraction (S/M/L/XL, numeric sizes)

**Medium-term Enhancements (Add LLM for Edge Cases):**
1. Use LLM (GPT-4o-mini / Gemini Flash) only for products where regex fails
2. Implement few-shot prompting for complex attributes (style, fit, occasion)
3. Add confidence scores to decide regex vs LLM routing
4. Build active learning loop for continuous improvement

**RAG Addition (For Creative Generation):**
- Retrieve product facts from catalog + reviews
- Generate grounded ad copy with citations
- Use extracted attributes as structured context for LLM

**Long-term Vision:**
1. Multi-modal extraction (extract attributes from product images)
2. Cross-lingual extraction (support multiple languages)
3. Hierarchical attribute extraction (parent-child relationships)
4. Anomaly detection (flag inconsistent attributes)
