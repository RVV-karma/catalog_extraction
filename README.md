### Slide 1: Problem Framing & KPIs

**Business Goal:**
Automate catalog enrichment to ensure product listings are complete, accurate, and consistent.

**Metrics Mapping:**

| Business Metric | Product Metric | Model Metric |
|----------------|----------------|--------------|
| Catalog Completeness | % products with all attributes | Extraction Coverage |
| Catalog Accuracy | Customer trust score | Precision, Recall, F1 |
| Processing Speed | Time to enrich catalog | Latency (ms/product) |
| Operational Cost | Budget efficiency | Cost per 1k products |

**Model/System Metrics:**
1. **Precision/Recall/F1** - Accuracy of extracted attributes against ground truth
2. **Extraction Coverage** - % of products with successful extraction
3. **Latency** - Average processing time per product
4. **Normalization Accuracy** - Consistency of value mapping (e.g., "navy" → "blue")

**Service SLOs:**
- **P95 Latency:** ≤ 100ms per product (rule-based, no LLM calls)
- **Cost per 1k requests:** $0 (pure regex/pattern matching, no API costs)
- **Accuracy Constraint:** ≥ 90% F1 for primary attributes (Color, Brand)

### Slide 3: Implementation (Catalog Understanding)

**Datasets:**
- **Product Catalog:** [Fashion Clothing Products Catalog (Myntra)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/fashion-clothing-products-catalog)
  - **Size:** 12,762 products
  - **Validation:** 1,500 sample products with ground truth
  - **Attributes:** ProductID, ProductName, Description, ProductBrand, Gender, PrimaryColor
- **Color Names:** [Color Names Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/avi1023/color-names)
  - **Size:** 1,291 color names
  - **Usage:** Pattern matching for color extraction

**Implementation Approach:**

**1. Color Extraction:**
- Loaded 1,291 color names, cleaned brackets/parentheses
- Added "grey" (British spelling) for dataset compatibility
- Regex matching in product name and description
- Handles multiple colors per product
- **HSL-based normalization:** Reduces 106 extracted colors → 11 base colors
  - Uses Hue, Saturation, Lightness values for color science-based mapping
  - Base colors: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Pink, Brown, Black, White, Grey
  - Examples: Navy → Blue, Mustard → Yellow, Beige → Brown

**2. Gender Extraction:**
- 18 gender terms (men, women, boys, girls, kids, unisex, etc.)
- Word boundary matching to avoid false positives
- Normalization: man→men, woman→women, boy→boys, etc.

**3. Brand Extraction (Hybrid Approach):**
- **Primary:** Uses extracted colors and genders as **boundaries**
- Extracts text before first gender/color keyword
- Handles hyphenated compound words (e.g., "Gold-Toned")
- Multi-word brand support (e.g., "U.S. Polo Assn.")
- **Fallback:** spaCy transformer NER when regex fails (1.07% of cases)
- Improves coverage from 98.93% → 99.40%

**Results:**

| Attribute | Total Products | Correct | Wrong | Accuracy | Coverage |
|-----------|---------------|---------|-------|----------|----------|
| **Color** | 1,378 | 1,377 | 1 | **99.93%** | 91.9% |
| **Gender** | 1,500 | 1,249 | 251 | **83.27%** | 100% |
| **Brand** | 1,500 | 1,405 | 95 | **93.67%** | 99.4% |

**Key Insights:**

- **Color Extraction:** Near-perfect accuracy. Only 1 error was a data quality issue (label: "Matte" instead of "Tan")
- **Gender Extraction:** Good performance. Errors mainly on products without gender keywords (jewelry, accessories, home items)
- **Brand Extraction:** Excellent accuracy with hybrid approach (93.67%). Improvements achieved by:
  - Using extracted colors/genders as boundaries (regex baseline: 93.47%)
  - Handling hyphenated compound words
  - Splitting on hyphens to detect color sub-words
  - Adding spaCy transformer NER fallback for edge cases (+0.20% accuracy, +0.47% coverage)

**Latency:**
- **Average (regex):** ~0.05ms per product (98.93% of cases)
- **Average (spaCy fallback):** ~50ms per product (1.07% of cases)
- **Effective average:** ~0.6ms per product
- **1,500 products:** ~900ms total (< 1 second)

**Cost:**
- **Near-zero** - No LLM API calls
- **spaCy inference:** Local transformer model (one-time download ~460MB)
- **Production cost:** $0 per request (runs on your infrastructure)

**Error Analysis:**

*Color Extraction (1 error):*
- Maybelline Foundation labeled as "Matte" (finish, not color) → Correctly extracted "Tan"

*Gender Extraction (251 errors):*
- 83% are products without gender keywords (bags, jewelry, home items, sarees)
- 1 data labeling error found: "Roadster Women Joggers" labeled as "Men"

*Brand Extraction (95 errors with hybrid approach):*
- Multi-word brands missing last word (e.g., "U.S. Polo Assn. Kids" → "U.S. Polo Assn.")
- Sub-brands included (e.g., "CASIO Enticer" instead of "CASIO")
- Hybrid approach reduced errors from 98 → 95 by using spaCy fallback for products without clear boundaries

### Slide 4: Rollout & Monitoring

**Testing Strategy:**

**Phase 1 - Offline Validation:**
1. **Unit Tests:** Test edge cases (hyphenated colors, multi-word brands, special characters)
2. **Red-team Prompts:** Test unusual product names, missing data, edge cases
3. **Ground Truth Validation:** Compare against 1,500 labeled products
4. **Error Analysis:** Categorize and prioritize error types

**Phase 2 - Shadow Mode:**
1. Run extraction pipeline in parallel with existing system
2. Compare results without affecting production
3. Monitor extraction coverage and accuracy
4. Identify patterns of failures

**Phase 3 - Canary Deployment:**
1. Roll out to 5% of catalog products
2. Monitor metrics:
   - **Extraction accuracy** (compare with manual labels)
   - **Processing latency** (P50, P95, P99)
   - **Coverage rate** (% products with extracted attributes)
   - **Error rate** (% failed extractions)

**Phase 4 - Gradual Rollout:**
1. Increase to 25% → 50% → 100% based on metrics
2. A/B test downstream impact (catalog completeness, search relevance)

**Monitoring Dashboard:**

| Metric | Target | Alert Threshold |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Color Accuracy | ≥ 99% | < 95% |
| Brand Accuracy | ≥ 93.5% | < 85% |
| Gender Accuracy | ≥ 83% | < 75% |
| P95 Latency | ≤ 100ms | > 200ms |
| Processing Errors | < 1% | > 5% |

**Rollback Criteria:**
- Accuracy drops > 10% from baseline
- P95 latency > 200ms
- Error rate > 5%
- Downstream metrics degradation (e.g., search quality)

**Continuous Improvement:**
1. **Weekly:** Review error samples, update regex patterns
2. **Monthly:** Retrain on new labeled data, expand color/gender dictionaries
3. **Quarterly:** Evaluate LLM-based extraction for zero-shot generalization

```

**Running the Pipeline:**

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run full extraction pipeline
python -m catalog_extraction.g_extract_all

# Run individual extractors
python -m catalog_extraction.b_color_extractor
python -m catalog_extraction.c_gender_extractor
python -m catalog_extraction.d_brand_extractor          # Regex-only
python -m catalog_extraction.e_brand_extractor_spacy    # spaCy NER comparison
python -m catalog_extraction.f_brand_extractor_hybrid   # Hybrid (BEST)
```

**Implementation Highlights:**

1. **Modular Design:** Each extractor is independent, can be used separately
2. **Reusability:** Color and gender extractors are reused by brand extractor
3. **Validation:** Built-in evaluation against ground truth
4. **No External Dependencies:** Pure pandas + regex (no LLM APIs)

**Future Work:**

**Why Start with Regex/Rules (Not LLM)?**
- ✅ **Zero cost** - No API charges
- ✅ **Fast** - < 0.1ms per product vs 100-500ms for LLM
- ✅ **Deterministic** - Predictable, debuggable, no hallucinations
- ✅ **Good baseline** - 93-99% accuracy for most attributes
- ✅ **Easy to maintain** - Update regex patterns vs prompt engineering

**Short-term Improvements:**
1. ✅ ~~Add fallback logic for brand extraction~~ → **Implemented hybrid approach (Regex + spaCy)**
2. Expand gender detection with product category hints (bra → women, saree → women)
3. Add material extraction (cotton, silk, leather, etc.)
4. Add size extraction (S/M/L/XL, numeric sizes)
5. Fine-tune spaCy NER on fashion domain for better fallback accuracy

**Medium-term Enhancements (Add LLM for Edge Cases):**
1. Use LLM (GPT-4o-mini / Gemini Flash) only for products where regex fails
2. Implement few-shot prompting for complex attributes (style, fit, occasion)
3. Add confidence scores to decide regex vs LLM routing
4. Build active learning loop for continuous improvement

**RAG Addition (For Creative Generation):**
- Retrieve product facts from catalog + reviews
- Generate grounded ad copy with citations
- Use extracted attributes as structured context for LLM

**Long-term Vision:**
1. Multi-modal extraction (extract attributes from product images)
2. Cross-lingual extraction (support multiple languages)
3. Hierarchical attribute extraction (parent-child relationships)
4. Anomaly detection (flag inconsistent attributes)

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Color Extraction
- 1,222 color names (cleaned from 1,291 original)
- Handles compound colors (e.g., "Gold-Toned" → "gold")
- Removes bracketed modifiers (e.g., "Green (Crayola)" → "green")
- British spelling support ("grey" added)
- **HSL-based normalization** using color science:
  - Hue (0-360°), Saturation (%), Lightness (%) from dataset
  - Achromatic colors (S < 10%): Black, White, Grey by lightness
  - Chromatic colors: Mapped by hue angle to 11 base colors
  - Reduces 106 color variants → 11 standardized colors
  - Examples: Navy (H=240°, L=25%) → Blue, Gold (H=51°, L=50%) → Brown

### Gender Extraction
- 18 gender terms with normalization
- Word boundary matching (avoids "women" matching in "women")
- Singular → Plural mapping (man → men, woman → women)

### Brand Extraction (Hybrid)
- **Primary Strategy (98.93% of products):** Regex-based boundary detection
  - Uses extracted colors and genders as boundaries
  - Extracts text before first gender/color keyword
  - Handles hyphenated compounds (splits "Gold-Toned" to detect "gold")
  - Preserves special characters (dots, ampersands, hyphens)
- **Fallback Strategy (1.07% of products):** spaCy Transformer NER
  - Loads `en_core_web_trf` model for organization entity recognition
  - Used only when regex finds no clear boundary
  - Adds +0.20% accuracy improvement and +0.47% coverage
- **Performance Comparison:**
  - Regex-only: 93.47% accuracy, 98.93% coverage
  - spaCy-only: 38.20% accuracy, 57.27% coverage
  - **Hybrid: 93.67% accuracy, 99.40% coverage** (best of both)

### Gender Detection: Hybrid Approach (Regex + Embedding Fallback)

We implemented a **hybrid gender extraction** strategy that combines regex precision with embedding-based fallback:

- **Primary Strategy (83.87% of products):** Regex-based keyword matching
  - Matches explicit gender terms in product names
  - High precision for products with clear gender keywords
  - Normalizes variants (man→men, woman→women, etc.)
  
- **Fallback Strategy (16.13% of products):** Instruction-tuned embeddings
  - Model: `intfloat/multilingual-e5-large-instruct`
  - Used only when regex finds no gender keywords
  - Instruction: "Classify the product as men, women, or unisex based on the product name"
  - Similarity threshold: 0.7 (higher threshold for precision)

- **Performance Comparison:**
  - Regex-only: 83.60% accuracy, 83.87% coverage
  - Embedding-only: 77.53% accuracy, 100.00% coverage
  - **Hybrid: 89.87% accuracy, 100.00% coverage** ✨

- **Key Benefits:**
  - +6.27% accuracy improvement over regex-only
  - 100% coverage (no products left unclassified)
  - Combines rule-based precision with ML generalization
  
- **Remaining Challenges:**
  - Women's accessories (bags, jewelry, bras) → "unisex" (lack of explicit gender keywords)
  - Could be improved with category-specific rules or fine-tuned models
